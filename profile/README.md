# Brazilian Football League
Created in November 2020, the Brazilian Football League (BFL) is the largest American Football community in [Haxball](https://www.haxball.com/).

In late 2021, its incumbent commissioner and programmer [@gabrielbrop](https://github.com/gabrielbrop) began the development of the BFL Bot from scratch, replacing the [old HaxFootball bot](https://gist.github.com/gabrielbrop/683618609abe07adc887c711b82d7683) made by members of the North American league.

In November 2022, the BFL Bot and [@gabrielbrop](https://github.com/gabrielbrop)'s associated works were publicly released as free software.
